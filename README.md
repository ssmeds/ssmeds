### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

#### I'm *Stina Smeds*

##### Front End Developer
I love to build great things such as web apps with fantastic UX/UI and flawless user flow.
Or just cool little projects to keep up with new technologies.



 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a software developer using mostly back end technologies but also TypeScript, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and SCSS.
 
 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying with Codecademy, CS50 and awesome YT tutorials.

 ðŸ’¬ I am always doing sideprojects with front end technologies to keep learning and advancing my stack.
